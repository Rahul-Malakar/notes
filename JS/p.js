// variable declare
// var myName;

// When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined

// var allows overwriting, let doesn't allow it give error
// const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. Once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned. Will show error if reassigned.

// In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

// Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope
