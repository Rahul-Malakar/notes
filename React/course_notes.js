// React defines what a component is and how multiple components work together

// ReactDOM knows how to get a component to show up in the browser or mobile devices

// jsx -> babel -> browser-runable-code
// browser doesn't understand jsx so we need babel
// why don't we write browser readable code is because of simplicity
